# Ai-Dev-Lab

when AI IDE is repeatedly not able to fix the issue by different prompts
  - generate different test samples for the issue, in the example folder, it is easy to isolate this way
  - when chat is giving unreleated fixes, or suggesetinos after long chat, start new chat
when ai changes too many files, unrelated to feature, or too many places in single file that is not wanted,
  - first iterate on chat, finalize exact list of changes, and then give this list to composer, this simplifes and reduces cognitive load of understanding ai generated code that is not related or incorrect code.
